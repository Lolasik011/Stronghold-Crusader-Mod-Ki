# The new AI Lords :

# The Rat

The rat has a better production and a better castle. In addition, she now has a better defense than the standard Ki. But he still builds pretty drunken castles


# The Snake

Snake now has two castles with the -S design. In addition, an increased production. The vacancies were completely removed because they are only a hindrance.

# The Pig

Pig now has a lot of evil things that better underline his character. And those stupid little walls were removed.

# The Wolf

Wolf does not have walls that are so thick anymore, which is good for his laziness. In addition, a better production which is much more constant than in the original. The bad things he builds because they fit very well to the wolf.

# Sultan Saladin

Sultan Saladin is relatively the same as in the original. He always builds exactly 6 towers which Obtisch looks very good in my opinion.

# The Caliph

The Caliph still has its typical castle design as in the original. Now 4 castles do not have a small wall and 4 castles not.

# The Sultan

Sultan is relatively the same as in the original. He only builds smaller castles.

# Richard the Lionheart

Richard now always has 2 gatehouses and almost never a small wall. He also has a better production.

# Kaiser Friedrich

Friedrich was not changed anything except that he was awarded all XBOW and BOW points.

# King Philippe
![Bild von Philippe](https://github.com/BonnieyTzw/Stronghold-Crusader-Mod-Ki/blob/master/Images/King%20Philippe.png?raw=true)
King Philippe now has an outer wall and a smaller Inner Castle. In addition, there are no more back castles

# The Sheriff
![Bild von Sheriff](https://github.com/BonnieyTzw/Stronghold-Crusader-Mod-Ki/blob/master/Images/The%20Sheriff.png?raw=true)
The Sheriff now has a small inner castle and a large Aussenburg which is historically very cool.

# The Marshall

The Marshall is just like many other castles stayed the same.
